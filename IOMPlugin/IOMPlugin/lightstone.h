Cross-platform driver for the Journey to Wild Divine Lightstone

Software website: http://liblightstone.nonpolynomial.com

@section liblightstoneIntro Introduction

liblightstone is an open source, cross platform library for reading data from the Journey to Wild Divine Lightstone biometrics widget.

@section liblightstoneBackground Background

Journey To Wild Divine is a video game that presents the player with the goal of relaxation. To chart how relaxed the player is, the game comes with a USB widget that records the Heart Rate Variance (HRV) via a PulseOx monitor, and Skin Conductance Level. These two metrics allows the software to know how well the player is taking in oxygen, their pulse rate, and their level of tension.

liblightstone was written to make this data available to any software. We built on the work of the developers behind the Lightstone Monitor software (http://sourceforge.net/projects/lsm/) to establish the protocol. LSM was originally written in C#, so we have ported the algorithms to C in order to make the software accessible to more platforms.

@section liblightstoneCaveats Lightstone Caveats

The lightstone is unfortunately not without its eccentricities.

- There are two versions of the lightstone that liblightstone knows about, with two completely different VID/PID pairs.
 - The blue lightstone has a VID/PID pair of {0x0483, 0x0035}
 - The white IOM device has a VID/PID pair of {0x14FA, 0x0001} (Blue devices of this pair have also been seen)
 - These are the only two pairs that liblightstone is aware of.
- The two versions put out completely different ranges for readings. Do not expect code with hardcoded ranges to work on both devices.
- Since the device registers as an HID device, any OS with an HID manager will pick it up and register it as such. On Linux and OS X, there is no way to access the device once this happens.
 - On Linux, liblightstone takes care of detaching the kernel driver from the device for the user. This can also be fixed permanently via udev rules.
 - On OS X, liblightstone requires that a null kext be in place in order to stop the kernel from picking up the device. This kext is distributed with the OS X library package for liblightstone, as well as in a standalone version.

@section liblightstoneHardwareInformation Hardware and Protocol Information

(This section is not relevant to using liblightstone, we simply lay out the protocol in case anyone else wants to implement their own version)

The lightstone has a STMicro ST7 chip that takes the readings from the sensors, converts them into text, and outputs them in ASCII form via HID reports. To computers, this will look like a USB HID device and will register as one also (see Lightstone Caveats section for more on this)

Since the device is working over the HID layer, the serial string comes in as a "Report". Reports usually consist of individual element updates from a controller (and only elements that have changed, to reduce bandwidth), but the lightstone uses them in a incorrect way. The protocol looks like:

- Always 8 Bytes per report according to descriptor (but we get back 9 for some reason). This MUST be read as a raw report, not as individual elements
- Byte 0 was ignored
- Byte 1 is the size of the useful part of the packet
- Bytes 2-8 are the actual data
- Messages end on 0x13 (ASCII newline), receiving that character is how we know when we've formed a complete message

The messages that the device sends looks like

- <RAW>AABB CCDD<\\RAW>
- <SER>XXXX<\\RAW>
- <VER>XXXX<\\RAW>

VER and SER messages identify the hardware, but are not useful otherwise. The RAW packet contains the HRV and SCL information, in the following format:

- HRV - ((AA << 8) | (BB)) * .01 (Returning a value between 1.6-2.5)
- SCR - ((CC << 8) | (DD)) * .001 (Returning a value between 3-15)
